Continuing my series of trying to figure out which team is best to pick for survival football and then ignoring it, I present my week 3 analysis. I used the same method as the <a href="http://alandgraf.blogspot.com/2010/09/nfl-survival-odds.html">past 2</a> <a href="http://alandgraf.blogspot.com/2010/09/week-2-nfl-survival-odds.html">weeks</a>, and didn't make any updates to it since last week. <br />Here we go:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_qD9db1gpElc/TJlSf0OSRNI/AAAAAAAAFfk/NXfI3JzlHKg/s1600/NFLsurvOddsWk3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_qD9db1gpElc/TJlSf0OSRNI/AAAAAAAAFfk/NXfI3JzlHKg/s640/NFLsurvOddsWk3.jpg" width="146" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>NE (53%), BAL (20%), WAS (8%), and MIN (7%) are the most common teams picked in the Yahoo! leagues. They are also the top four teams according to my metric in a different order.<br />This week has NE favored by the most that they will be favored by for the rest of the season and by quite a bit so it makes sense that they are ranked at the top. Maybe the biggest difference between this analysis and the Yahoo! distribution is that Baltimore has 20% of Yahoo! but is just fourth best here. I would have to say that my numbers make more sense because Baltimore has three more games with a spread of 10 or higher and couple more with a spread higher than 6. I am surprised that Washington is up on both lists because they are only favored by 4 and playing an away game. Although they only have one more playable game and that is a 6 point favorite.<br />I would definitely pick New England this week if perfection is your goal.</div>
