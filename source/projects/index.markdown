### Visualization with shiny
Below are some visualizations I have done using [shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/):

[Look at how the average age of a person based on their name has changed](http://spark.rstudio.com/andland/AgeByNameYear/)

[Calculate the probability that one person is older than another, based only on their names](http://spark.rstudio.com/andland/ProbabilityOlderByName/)

[Most popular songs on CD102.5 in 2013](http://spark.rstudio.com/andland/CD1025Playlist/)

[Interactive visualization of penalized regression](http://spark.rstudio.com/andland/PenalizedRegression/)
