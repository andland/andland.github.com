"I just saw the movie, Limitless, which was, you know, really well made, but it was weird. The main character is a novelist, and he takes a pill and realizes all his intellectual potential. He can do anything now, because he's so smart. So he writes his novel in four days, and then he gives up writing to go into, like, speculating on the market. And there's no critique of that. That's our hero - this guy who's going to make a lot of money. On the other hand, maybe that's a great reflection of how our country operates. Granted, I fell asleep, so maybe they critique his actions a little bit in the end. But I don't think so."</div>
