I am a graduate student in the [Department of Statistics](http://stat.osu.edu) at Ohio State. I am interested in machine learning applications in statistics. My advisor is [Dr. Yoonkung Lee](http://www.stat.osu.edu/~yklee/). I work as a graduate research associate for the [Campus Transit Lab](http://transitlab.osu.edu/campus-transit-lab) in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering with [Dr. Prem Goel](http://www.stat.osu.edu/people/faculty/prem-k-goel), [Dr. Rabi Mishalani](http://ceg.osu.edu/people/mishalani.1), and [Dr. Mark McCord](http://ceg.osu.edu/people/mccord.2). There, I have mainly been working on two projects. One is developing methods to estimate origin-destination patterns of travelers on public transportation. The other is assessing the impact the public transportation use has on greenhouse gas emissions. Also, I am a part-time contractor with [IGS Energy](http://www.igsenergy.com), where I am in charge of maintaining, evaluating, and updating electricity load forecasting methodologies.
