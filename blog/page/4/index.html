Forgive me if you are already aware of this, but I found it quite alarming. I know that most code is interpreted by the computer in binary and we input in decimal, so problems can arise in conversion and with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point">floating point</a>. But the example I have below is so simple that it really surprised me.<br /><br />I was converting a function from R into MATLAB so that a colleague could use it. I tested it out on the same data and got slightly different results. Digging into the problem, the difference was due to the fact that R was rounding 4.5 to 4 and MATLAB was rounding it to 5. I thought the &#8220;4.5&#8221; must have really been &#8220;4.49999&#8230;&#8221;. But that was not so.<br /><br />For example, this is the result of the <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Round.html">round</a> function for a few numbers.<br /><pre class="brush: r">&gt; round(0.5,0)<br />[1] 0<br />&gt; round(1.5,0)<br />[1] 2<br />&gt; round(2.5,0)<br />[1] 2<br />&gt; round(3.5,0)<br />[1] 4<br />&gt; round(4.5,0)<br />[1] 4<br />&gt; round(5.5,0)<br />[1] 6<br />&gt; round(6.5,0)<br />[1] 6<br /></pre><br />Do you see a pattern?<br /><br />I tried this on versions 2.13.1 and 2.14.0. I ran the same with MATLAB and it gave the expected results. I am not any kind of expert on computer sciences, so I was not sure why this is happening. <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal-converter.html">Converting </a>any decimal number that ends in .5 into binary results in a finite length binary number. For example, 4.5 is 100.1 in binary. Because of this, I wouldn&#8217;t think the error would be due to floating points, but I really don&#8217;t know.<br /><br />Looking at the <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Round.html">documentation</a> for round, I found the reason. It states in the notes, &#8220;Note that for rounding off a 5, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008#Rounding_rules">IEC 60559 standard</a> is expected to be used, ‘<em>go to the even digit</em>’.&#8221; It is a little comforting knowing that there is a logic behind it and that R is abiding to some standard. But why isn&#8217;t MATLAB abiding by the same standard? Also, I think most people expect numbers ending in .5 to round up, not the nearest even digit.</div>

Andrew wrote &quot;Also, I think most people expect numbers ending in .5 to round up (not the nearest even digit)&quot;. This kind of rounding is in German called &quot;kaufmännische Rundung&quot; (rounding in commerce). For this purpose I use the following function:<br /><br />#Definition of a function for &quot;rounding in commerce&quot;<br />cround = function(x,n){<br />vorz = sign(x)<br />z = abs(x)*10^n<br />z = z + 0.5<br />z = trunc(z)<br />z = z/10^n<br />z*vorz<br />}<br /><br /># Example<br />&gt; round(seq(0.5,6.5,1),0)<br />[1] 0 2 2 4 4 6 6<br />&gt; cround(seq(0.5,6.5,1),0)<br />[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7</div>

This &quot;round to even&quot; approach has been accepted by just about everyone (except matlab, and no surprise, except Msoft Excel).  <br />Sadly, the flame wars over &quot;round to even&quot; vs. &quot;round up&quot; continue, rather the way people argue about &quot;0.999&#8230; != 1&quot;<br /><br />PS: @a Tom:  I&#39;m highly skeptical of your <br />claim about 2.46&#8211;&gt;3.  Do you have a citation?</div>

I&#39;m ever amazed that something so seemingly basic can have so many different approaches.<br /><br />I understand that in many middle east countries they start with the far right digit and round up or down, so 2.46 is rounded to 3!</div>

This is discussed in Don Knuth&#39;s 1973 classic Seminumerical Algorithms. He gives the following example of what can happen when 5s are always rounded upwards. Suppose u = 10000000 and v = 0.5555556. Then u + v = 1.5555556. If we subtract v from this  result we get u&#39; = 1.0000001. Adding and then subtracting v from u&#39; and we get 1.0000002 and if we do it again we get 1.0000003 and so on. He says &quot;This phenomenon, called drift, will not occur when we use a stable rounding rule based on the parity of the least significant digit.&quot;</div>

I was the #2 anonymous poster. Echoing Ben, I think that for ease of teaching, the &quot;round 5 up&quot; method is taught to children (and adults?) below the university level, and only if you go on for advance work is the more complicated method taught.<br /><br />Can you imagine trying to teach a 10 or 12 year old the IEC 60559 standard? Unfortunately, this is the method most adults are used to&#8230;<br /><br />I agree, it is a little troubling that Matlab doesn&#39;t abide by the standard. Yet another reason to stick with R!</div>

Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even ) says of round-to-even:<br /><br />This method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of y values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for even numbers (including zero), and a negative bias for the odd ones.<br /><br />So round-to-even seems to have *slightly* better numerical properties than &quot;round ties away from zero&quot;, which is what is (I think) most often taught, because it&#39;s easier to understand. http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6752 gives a MATLAB function for &quot;round to even&quot;.<br /><br />If I had to guess I would predict that in borderline cases (which this certainly is) MATLAB would favor &quot;do what will lead to happier users&quot; and R would favor &quot;do what is thought to be the best numerical practice&quot;.</div>

Hi,<br />I&#39;m not sure I understand what you mean by &quot;expected results&quot;?<br /><br />Regarding rounding, I was taught to round numbers ending in &quot;1, 2, 3, and 4&quot; *down*, and numbers that ended in &quot;6, 7, 8, 9&quot; *up*. Then, specifically regarding &quot;5&quot;, if the preceding digit is odd, round up and if the preceding digit is even, to round down. <br /><br />As you can see, this will then result in 50% of the numbers being rounded up, and 50% rounded down. If you round *down* on &quot;1, 2, 3, 4&quot; and round up on &quot;5, 6, 7, 8, 9&quot; you are rounding up 5/9th&#39;s of the time, and so introducing a bias.<br /><br />It sounds like R is handling it the way I would. Is that what you were wondering about?</div>

I was having some fun with PITCHf/x data and generalize additive models. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PITCHf/x">PITCHf/x</a> keeps track of the trajectory, path, location of every pitch in the MLB. It is pretty accurate and opens up baseball to more analyses than ever before. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model">Generalized additive models</a> (GAMs) are statistical models that put minimal assumptions on the type of model you are fitting. Traditional statistical models are linear, in that they assume that the response variable you are modelling is a linear function of the explanatory variables. GAMs just assumes that the relationship is &#8220;smooth.&#8221; <a href="http://www.stat.ubc.ca/%7Ematias/rgam/binomial.png">Here </a>is a good example of a relationship that may have traditionally been modeled as linear, but it is a much better assumption that the relationship is smooth.<br /><br />I fit a GAM to PITCHf/x data. The response is whether or not Ichiro swung. The explanatory variables are pitch location on the x, pitch location on the z, and the day of the year. Obviously, we expect the probability of swinging to change as the pitch is closer or further away from the center of the strike zone. Additionally, I was interested in seeing his swinging propensity changed as the year went on.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/44X9VXXjYPI/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/44X9VXXjYPI?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" />  <param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" />  <embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/44X9VXXjYPI?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><br />You can see that the probability of swinging is smooth in both location and time. Also, you can see (ever so slightly) that the probability of swinging increased as the year went on. Looking at <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=suzukic01&amp;year=2010&amp;t=b#half">the splits</a>, you can see that his walk percentage was 28/395 (7.1%) in the first half and 17/337 (5.0%) in the second half. This is in agreement with the swing probability increasing,<br /><br />I used the <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/sw283/mgcv/tampere/mgcv.pdf">mgcv </a>package in R to run the GAM. I created an image for every day and stitched them together into a movie with <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>. The R code is <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B21DLJKq18K9ejNUX0RXQnlJam8">here</a>.</div>

Don&#8217;t you hate it when you are running a long piece of code and you keep checking the results every 15 minutes, hoping it will finish? There is a better way.<br /><br />I got the idea from <a href="http://jbdeaton.com/2012/send-yourself-an-sms-via-python/">here</a>. He uses a Python script and the text interface is not free. I thought someone must have already thought of this for R. There is an easy solution. You can send an email fairly easily in R. You can also send <a href="http://allthingsmarked.com/2006/09/04/howto-send-free-text-messages-through-email/">text messages as emails</a>. <a href="http://www.decisionstats.com/send-email-by-r/">This page </a>gives a few examples of how to send an email in R. Sending a text via email will depend on what carrier you have and I am sure standard text message fees apply.You can only send 20 emails a day with this package, but that probably won&#8217;t be a big deal.<br /><br />It is basically a one-liner. Here is the code I used:<br /><pre class="brush: r">install.packages("mail",repos="http://cran.case.edu/")<br />library(mail)<br />sendmail("5555555555@txt.att.net", <br />         subject="Notification from R",message="MCMC Finished", password="rmail")<br /></pre><br />That&#8217;s it!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DaUTmyXUfks/T7_mu1CRtII/AAAAAAAAG8Y/Ike9L7_C_yI/s1600/photo.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DaUTmyXUfks/T7_mu1CRtII/AAAAAAAAG8Y/Ike9L7_C_yI/s320/photo.PNG" width="212" /></a></div></div>

Recently, Chris Perez, the closer for the Indians, displayed <a href="http://throwinheat.mlblogs.com/2012/05/20/chris-perez-expands-on-his-comments-mark-shapiro-responds/">some frustration </a>with the fans for not supporting the team. Currently, they have the <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/current_attendance.shtml">lowest attendance </a>in the majors &#8211; by a decent margin. The Indians are averaging about 15,000 fans per home game, while the next closest team, the Oakland A&#8217;s, is averaging 19,000. It seemed like an odd time for Perez to bring this up because they <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2012-schedule-scores.shtml">have had </a>attendance in the 29,000s each of the last two home games. So that intrigued me to look into the numbers of what causes attendance to vary.<br /><br />I looked at <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2011-schedule-scores.shtml">2011 attendance data </a>for the Cleveland Indians only. I had a strong suspicion that a popular opponent would definitely and weekend games cause attendance to increase. Also, there is usually some press at the beginning of the season that claims no one wants to go to the games because it is too cold for baseball. (There is also more competing entertainment at the beginning of the season.)<br /><br />What I found to be significant (based on an exploratory approach) are summarized in the graph below. This plot explores the relationship of attendance with 5 other variables. I plotted attendance on the y-axis and the date on the x-axis. I don&#8217;t expect date to have any effect, but it organizes other aspects well (and you can see opening day had the highest attendance of the year). Instead of plotting points, I plotted the name of the opponent. You can see there are some larger attendances when they are playing the New York Yankees and the Cincinnati Reds, for example. The color of the team name indicates whether they are playing on the weekend or not and the size indicates the <a href="http://academic.udayton.edu/kissock/http/Weather/citylistUS.htm">temperature</a>. Probably the biggest effect, weekend games outdraw weekday games consistently. The colder temperatures are only in the beginning of the season, and seem to have a noticeable effect (at least for the coldest days).<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-c7JBG0k4OBQ/T7kvpyZYOmI/AAAAAAAAG20/tC71mpum_lA/s1600/IndainsAttendance2011.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="633" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-c7JBG0k4OBQ/T7kvpyZYOmI/AAAAAAAAG20/tC71mpum_lA/s640/IndainsAttendance2011.jpeg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />I also looked into how many games above .500 the team was and how close they were in the division race. Neither of these showed any correlation, at least at the marginal level. This is interesting because the main reason Chris Perez is frustrated is that the team is winning, so the fans should be supporting them. This shows that wining did not make much of a difference within a single year. This should be more prevalent over multiple years.<br /><br />Some other information that might be useful is the quality of the opponent or whether the ace of the opposing pitching staff is starting. I only included temperature and not precipitation or any other weather information.<br /><br />Here is the basic R code I used: <br /><pre class="brush: r">library(ggplot2)<br />ggplot(data=home.attend,aes(x=Date,y=Attendance,colour=Weekend,label=Opp,size=Temp))+<br />  geom_text()+scale_size(to = c(2, 5))+theme_bw()&nbsp;</pre><pre class="brush: r">&nbsp;</pre><i><b>Update (9/21/2013)</b></i>:<br />Since attendance is still a hot topic, I created the same plot for the 2013 season so far.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MiH0WF4KyGU/Uj5E45dKMSI/AAAAAAAAH9A/3MoE4VGYjUA/s1600/IndainsAttendance2013.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-MiH0WF4KyGU/Uj5E45dKMSI/AAAAAAAAH9A/3MoE4VGYjUA/s1600/IndainsAttendance2013.jpeg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mT8HBGEKwak/Uj5EauQomGI/AAAAAAAAH84/qB4e0VE6n94/s1600/IndainsAttendance2013.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a></div><br /></div>

After signing a huge deal with the Angels, Pujols has been having a really bad year. He hasn&#8217;t hit a home run this year, breaking a career long streak. So I thought it would be a good idea to use some statistics to tell how good or bad we think Pujols will actually be this year.<br /><br />Coming into the year, he had a career .328/.420/.617 career AVG/OBP/SLG. Through one month, he has a .194/.237/.269. So what do we expect out of Pujols for the rest of the year?<br /><br />In Bayesian statistical terms, we can quantify our prior beliefs about Pujols from his history before this year. Below are histograms and fitted distributions of Pujols&#8217; yearly batting lines from 2001 to 2011. His numbers are well above normal and he has been the best player in baseball for a while.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eBkY_jm8kn0/T6WDvtfUlZI/AAAAAAAAGss/dNE4TkjFC6I/s1600/pujols.bmp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eBkY_jm8kn0/T6WDvtfUlZI/AAAAAAAAGss/dNE4TkjFC6I/s1600/pujols.bmp" /></a></div>So coming into this year, we would expect him to have a batting average between .290 and .370, with .330 being the most likely, for example.<br /><br />Combining our prior expectations with the data we have observed from this year, we can get our posterior beliefs. When we do that, we get a posterior expectation that Pujols is a true .312/.379/.451 hitter. The league averages from 2001 to 2011 are .263/.331/.418, so he is still expected to be well above the average player, even with the poor start. If we use data from just this year, we do not have enough data to give us an accurate reflection of how good he is. If we combine the data with our prior beliefs, we get a better indication of what to expect. Below is a table that compares these numbers.<br /><br /><style type="text/css">.nobrtable br { display: none } </style><br /><div class="nobrtable"><table border="2" bordercolor="#3366cc" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" style="background-color: white;"><tbody><tr style="background-color: #3366cc; color: white; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-top: 5px;"> <th><br /></th><th>AVG</th><th>OBP</th><th>SLG</th></tr><tr><td>League</td><td>.263</td><td>.331</td><td>.418</td></tr><tr><td>Prior</td><td>.328</td><td>.420</td><td>.617</td></tr><tr><td>This Year</td><td>.194</td><td>.237</td><td>.269</td></tr><tr><td>Posterior</td><td>.312</td><td>.379</td><td>.451</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Finally, we can also get the whole posterior distribution (not just the expectation). I have plotted the prior and posterior distributions on the same graph. You can see that Pujols&#8217; bad month has caused our beliefs about him to decrease quite a bit. Most notable is the slugging percentage, which is likely because of his career-long homerless streak.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZmO18a8vj0w/T6WLW6LnjsI/AAAAAAAAGs4/ll2ab7sGJAg/s1600/pujols-prior+and+posterior.bmp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZmO18a8vj0w/T6WLW6LnjsI/AAAAAAAAGs4/ll2ab7sGJAg/s1600/pujols-prior+and+posterior.bmp" /></a></div><br />What Bayesian analysis does is shrinks (or regresses) the data from this year to the prior average. This is&nbsp; the same idea of regressing to the overall mean that is talked about frequently in sabermetric blogs. The difference is that regressing to the mean usually regresses to the average player in the league. With Bayesian analysis, we can regress to our prior expectation about the specific player (Albert Pujols). I believe this approach will give us better results in most cases.<br /><br />The R code to do the analysis can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B21DLJKq18K9NkNJb0lQRHNqbHM">here</a>.

Just a follow up: From May 6 to the end of the season he had a .305/.365/.569 split. The posterior expectation of .312/.379/.451 matches the average and on base percentage well, but his actual slugging is quite a bit higher than the posterior distribution would have predicted.<br /><br />Not sure what to make of this except to say he had a really bad start with slugging, which may have been caused more by random chance than the other two. And obviously the distributional assumptions are an approximation to reality.</div>
